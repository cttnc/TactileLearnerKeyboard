# TactileLearnerKeyboard
For helping naturally build a predictable spatial experience of typed words.

This is experimental, experimenting first on my own experience of whether making the keyboard feel topologically mapped makes it integrate more deeply with my own synesthetic experience of words, since i am autistic and hyperlexic. if it does, or if i can keep experimenting until i can get it to sync in to my experience of words, i feel it may be possible that having access to the experience via the best i can do to apply the experience to the keyboard may help other autistic folk who have trouble with making written words stick spatially, since they are 2D, and autistic people typically have a spatial relationship with language, experience written words as 3D structures and see, based on community feedback, if this helps the words attach to user's deeper understandings in a way that creates a more natural interface between autistic spatially-inclined understanding of language, and 2D typing and words.
